Theory of Programming
----
This is the GitHub code repository for the educational website [Theory of Programming](http://theoryofprogramming.com/). Theory of Programming is a website for computer science geeks who want to learn data structures, algorithms, Java, C, etc. The codes in this repository are the codes which are displayed in the website's posts.

### Contributing
You can contribute to Theory of Programming by -
* Providing implementations of algorithms and data structures in other languages than which already exist. Allowed languages are C, C++, Java, C# and Python.
* Finding bugs in existing code. Please [raise a new issue](https://github.com/VamsiSangam/theoryofprogramming/issues/new) if you find any bugs in the existing codes.
* Or any other idea which might make this repo more helpful. Raise a new issue for the same.

### Guidelines

* You agree to license your contributions under the [license](https://github.com/VamsiSangam/theoryofprogramming/blob/master/LICENSE).
* Use pull requests early so it's open for discussion, even if your contribution isn't ready yet.
* Ask doubts in your pull request or the issue page corresponding to your contribution.
* Please follow the [directory structure](https://github.com/VamsiSangam/theoryofprogramming/blob/master/STRUCTURE.md) strictly.
* Your code must strictly follow the [coding conventions](https://github.com/VamsiSangam/theoryofprogramming/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md).

### Contact
You can [raise a new issue](https://github.com/VamsiSangam/theoryofprogramming/issues/new) if you want to ask questions. Feel free to use the issues as a forum. Alternatively, but less preferably, contact me by mail ```vamsisangam@live.com```.
